# AB-Lossless-Image-Compression-Exploiting-the-Periodicity-of-the-Pixels-of-Image

The Image can be written in RGB (Red-Green-Blue) Colour Tensor of dimension N x N x 3 , with the element value ranging from 0 to 255 as the pixel values. Now each of the R,G,B tensor is separated out to form 3 Matrices of dimension N x N . These Pixel values can be written in the form of dictionary with keys as the pixel values and the corresponding value as list of all the positions of that element in ascending order by flattening out the R,G,B matrices in vector. Now it is question of how to decode the pixel position in the matrices (can number theory be used to decode the information in real time to achieve a very high lossless compression ratio) , that is what this lossless image compression technique is all about !!! Here we use the overfit curvefit with the spline polynomial equation for compressing the plotted 255 graphs from the postion elements to the coefficient storing of the overfit curvefit equation and report the lossless compression ratio of nearly 1.5 , also quantization of the coefficients of the equation to nearest integers can be done to reduce the storing memory further with little (dithering can be used) to no loss of image information. As this problem boils down to periodicity problem can periodicity of the pixel values be found out in real time is another question that can be raised here ?

As a demo an image's red channel matrix is written in dictionary format and then overfit curvefit (a basis of all ML classification Algorithms) is used to report the image compression ratio of 1000000/705455 = 1.41752. Further research includes exploring other ways (other than curvefit) like number theory, periodicity for pattern recognization , Quantization of the image , other present research approaches applied for this novel way of image compression.

PS - You guys might be wondering why the name AB ? Well A stands for Akshay and B for Britant a coauthor of this research...
